# LiquidAuth
Liquid auth is a light weight user authentication system that I hope to build into something more, eventually.  

I designed liquid auth to be flexible, usable from multiple applications, if the developer sees fit, lightweight, and secure.  
Liquid Auth uses BCrypt hashing algorithm.  

TODO: 
Improve database creation process, currently it is not optimal.  
Add more user profile fields.  
Switch current output to json output for a more usable 'api'
